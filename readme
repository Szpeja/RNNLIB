RNNLIB is currently only tested for Linux and OSX.

Building it requires the following: 

- A modern C++ compiler (e.g. gcc 3.0 or higher)
- GNU Automake version 1.9 (NOTE: will not work with version 1.10)
- the NetCDF scientific data library. 
- Boost C++ Libraries (headers only)

In addition, the following python packages are needed for the auxiliary scripts in the ‘utils’ directory:

- SciPy
- matplotlib
- PIL

And this package is needed to create and manipulate netcdf data files with python, and to run the experiments in the ‘examples’ directory:

- ScientificPython (NOT Scipy)

To build RNNLIB enter the root directory and type

./configure
make

This should create the binary file ‘rnnlib’ in the ‘src’ directory.

If you wish to install the binary into another directory, type:

make install

By default this will use ‘/usr’ as the installation root (for which you will usually need administrator privileges).
You can change the install path with the —prefix option of the configure script (use ./configure —help for other options)

It is recommended that you add the directory containing the ‘rnnlib’ binary to your path,
as otherwise the tools in the ‘utilities’ directory will not work.
